# Question Structure Design

Application of Phase 2: anomaly-based backward design of question structure for each paradigm.

## Step 1: Anomaly Target Setting

### P0 Anomalies (vs T)

P0 incorrectly predicts:
- Fs-10=1 (alone) → T: 0 (companions present)
- Fs-17=1 (heat stroke) → T: 0 (fell from height)
- Fs-91=0 (not group) → T: 1 (group)
- Fs-88=0 (not external crisis) → T: 1 (external crisis)
- Fs-69=0 (not lottery) → T: 1 (lottery)
- Fs-49=0 (not fall) → T: 1 (fall)
- Fs-48=0 (not transported) → T: 1 (transported)
- Ft-8=0 (not air) → T: 1 (air)

Target anomaly questions for P0: ~4 (need enough anomalies to trigger shift to P1)

Key anomalies to drive P0→P1 shift:
1. Fs-91=0 (not group) → must discover: YES, group was involved
2. Fs-88=0 (not crisis) → must discover: YES, external crisis
3. Fs-10=1 (alone) → must discover: NO, not alone

### P1 Anomalies (vs T)

P1 incorrectly predicts:
- Ft-8=0 (not air) → T: 1 (air)

Key anomalies for P1→P2 shift:
1. Ft-8=0 (not aerial) → must discover: YES, aerial

### P2 Anomalies (vs T)

P2 incorrectly predicts:
- Fs-69=0 (matchstick not lottery) → T: 1 (lottery)

Key anomalies for P2→P3 shift:
1. Fs-69=0 (not lottery) → must discover: YES, lottery mechanism

### P3 Anomalies (vs T)

P3 incorrectly predicts:
- Ft-2=0 (not specifically balloon) → T: 1 (hot air balloon)

Key anomaly for P3→P4 shift:
1. Ft-2=0 → must discover: YES, hot air balloon

## Step 2: Cognitive Reach-Back Design

### P0 → P1 anomaly paths

**Target: Discover group involvement (Fs-91=1)**

Backward path:
- To think "were others involved?" the player needs to find the lone-person theory inadequate
- Layer 2: Q asking about other people → reveals Fs-91=1 (anomaly for P0)
- Layer 1: Q about why the man was in the desert → reveals Fs-43 context
- Layer 0: Q about whether the death was accidental → entry point

**Target: Discover external crisis (Fs-88=1)**

Backward path:
- To think "was the nakedness from a crisis?" player needs to reject simpler explanations
- Layer 2: Q about crisis-driven clothing removal → reveals Fs-88=1 (anomaly for P0)
- Layer 1: Q about why the man was naked → explores reasons
- Layer 0: Q about whether nakedness relates to the cause of death → entry point

### P1 → P2 anomaly paths

**Target: Discover aerial arrival (Ft-8=1)**

Backward path:
- To think "did he arrive by air?" player needs to notice absence of tracks
- Layer 2: Q about arriving from above → reveals Ft-8=1 (anomaly for P1)
- Layer 1: Q about transportation method → explores how he got to desert
- Layer 0: Q about tracks or vehicle → entry point

### P2 → P3 anomaly paths

**Target: Discover lottery mechanism (Fs-69=1)**

Backward path:
- To think "was the matchstick a lottery?" player needs to see the matchstick as purposeful
- Layer 2: Q about match-drawing → reveals Fs-69=1 (anomaly for P2)
- Layer 1: Q about matchstick significance → why gripping it
- Layer 0: Q about matchstick purpose → entry point (available from start)

### P3 → P4 anomaly paths

**Target: Discover hot air balloon (Ft-2=1)**

Backward path:
- Layer 1: Q about type of vehicle → reveals Ft-2=1
- Layer 0: Q about what type of flying vehicle → prereqs from P3 knowledge

## Step 3: Layer Placement

### P0 layers
- Layer 0: Initial exploration questions (no prerequisites) — cause of death, crime hypothesis, illness hypothesis, matchstick purpose, location significance
- Layer 1: Follow-up based on initial findings — nakedness reason, transportation method
- Layer 2: Anomaly questions — group involvement, external crisis

### P1 layers
- Layer 0: Group-related initial questions (from P0 context) — companions, vehicle type
- Layer 1: Transportation investigation — how they traveled, tracks absence
- Layer 2: Aerial arrival discovery

### P2 layers
- Layer 0: Aerial-based questions — what aircraft, altitude
- Layer 1: Match significance — purpose, selection
- Layer 2: Lottery mechanism discovery

### P3 layers
- Layer 0: Lottery/sacrifice questions — details of decision
- Layer 1: Specific vehicle — balloon vs plane
- Layer 2: Hot air balloon discovery

### Gate edges (R(P) additions)

- P0: Fs-7 → Fs-91 (w=0.4) — investigating unusual death leads to considering others
- P1: Fs-91 → Ft-8 (w=0.4) — knowing group exists leads to asking how they traveled
- P2: Ft-8 → Fs-69 (w=0.4) — knowing aerial arrival leads to asking about matchstick significance
- P3: Ft-62 → Ft-2 (w=0.4) — knowing lottery mechanism leads to asking about vehicle type

## Step 4: Material Sufficiency Check

No critical gaps detected. The descriptor space has sufficient coverage for:
- Alternative hypotheses (crime, survival, illness) — in Fs denial alternatives
- Transportation modes — in Fs and Ft
- Matchstick interpretations — in Fs-61 through Fs-78
- Group dynamics — in Ft-18 through Ft-27
- Escalation narrative — in Ft-38 through Ft-59

Material sufficiency: OK
