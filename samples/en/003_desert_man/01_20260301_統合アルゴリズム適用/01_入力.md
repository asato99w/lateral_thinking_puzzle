## S (Problem Statement)

A naked man was found dead in the middle of the desert, gripping a matchstick in his hand.

## T (Truth)

The man was in a hot air balloon with several companions. As the altitude dropped, they discarded all cargo, then removed their clothes to lighten the load—but it wasn't enough. They decided by drawing matches (the shorter match bearer had to jump). The man drew the short match and jumped from the balloon, dying from the fall.
