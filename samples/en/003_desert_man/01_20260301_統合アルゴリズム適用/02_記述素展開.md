### 異常性検出 (Applied to Ps)

- Fs-80: Gripping a single matchstick at death is highly unusual — matchsticks are mundane objects not normally held at death
- Fs-81: The combination of nakedness + desert + matchstick is deeply anomalous — each element contradicts normal desert scenarios

### 緊張関係抽出 (Applied to all Ps pairs)

- Fs-82: (Ps-1 × Ps-2) The man is dead and naked — the nakedness is not a typical feature of desert deaths and requires additional explanation
- Fs-83: (Ps-1 × Ps-3) A dead man in the desert without apparent cause — how did he die and how did he get there?
- Fs-84: (Ps-1 × Ps-4) A dead man gripping a matchstick — what role did the matchstick play in his death?
- Fs-85: (Ps-2 × Ps-3) Naked in the desert — desert conditions make nakedness particularly dangerous and unusual
- Fs-86: (Ps-2 × Ps-4) Naked but holding a matchstick — clothes removed but a small object retained, suggesting selective action

## E1 Step 3: 上位概念化

### From Fs₁ (Ps-derived)

- Fs-88: The man's nakedness was caused by an external circumstance, not personal choice (upper concept of Fs-28, Fs-29)

### From Ft₁ (Pt-derived)

- Ft-90: The group faced a survival crisis in the air (upper concept of Ft-33, Ft-34, Ft-37)
- Ft-91: A series of escalating sacrifices was made (upper concept of Ft-42, Ft-46, Ft-57: cargo → clothes → person)

## E1 Step 4: 合成

### Fs × Ft synthesis

- D-1: (Fs-48 × Ft-8) The man was transported to the desert by air — explaining the absence of tracks or vehicle
- D-2: (Fs-29 × Ft-51) The clothes were removed for weight reduction, not due to desert conditions
- D-3: (Fs-69 × Ft-66) The matchstick in the hand was the losing lot from a life-or-death drawing
- D-4: (Fs-49 × Ft-84) The man fell from a great height — connecting the desert body to the balloon scenario
- D-5: (Fs-42 × Ft-8) The question "how did he get to the desert" is answered by "he arrived by air and fell"
- D-6: (Fs-47 × Ft-9) The absence of tracks near the body is explained by aerial arrival
- D-7: (Fs-91 × Ft-24) Other people were involved and they survived — the man was the only casualty
- D-8: (Fs-22 × Ft-51) The reason for nakedness connects to the balloon weight crisis — clothes were discarded as a desperate measure

### Fs × Fs synthesis

- D-9: (Fs-27 × Fs-80) Nakedness + matchstick is doubly anomalous — the combination of these two unusual features is the core mystery
- D-10: (Fs-89 × Fs-92) The man arrived from elsewhere AND was in a life-threatening situation — the journey itself was dangerous

### Ft × Ft synthesis

- D-11: (Ft-91 × Ft-94) The escalating sacrifices (cargo → clothes → person) and the matchstick lottery form a coherent causal chain
- D-12: (Ft-93 × Ft-95) The sacrificial death (falling from the sky) connects the moral dimension to the physical cause of death

### Abstracted synthesis

- D-13: (Fs-93 × Ft-91) The anomalous features of the body (naked, matchstick, desert) each correspond to a stage in the escalating crisis
- D-14: (Fs-90 × Ft-92) The matchstick as a selection device + collective decision under duress = a lottery-based sacrifice

## E2 Step 1: 架け橋合成

- B-1: (Fs-26 × Ft-51) The nakedness has an explanation related to a crisis — not madness, crime, or ritual
- B-2: (Fs-65 × Ft-66) The matchstick is a clue to the death mechanism — it connects to a specific event, not a random object
- B-3: (Fs-41 × Ft-9) The absence of vehicle or transportation at the scene is because the transportation left (the balloon flew away)
- B-4: (Fs-7 × Ft-84) The unnatural death was caused by a fall, not by desert exposure
- B-5: (Fs-10 × Ft-18) The man appeared to be alone but was actually with companions — the companions left the scene (in the balloon)

## E2 Step 2: 部分的理解生成

### 抽象化による一般化

- M-1: The man was part of a group in a dangerous situation (from Pt-2 + Pt-3)
- M-2: Something was discarded or sacrificed to survive (from Pt-4, Pt-5, Pt-6)
- M-3: A random or chance-based decision was involved (from Pt-7, Pt-8)
- M-4: The man fell from a height (from Pt-9)

### 条件付き推論

- M-5: If the man was part of a group, the others may still be alive
- M-6: If the clothes were removed deliberately, there must have been an urgent reason
- M-7: If the matchstick was part of a drawing, multiple matches existed and only one was short

### 部分的暴露

- M-8: The man died because of a selection or decision process, not by accident or murder
- M-9: The man was not in the desert by choice — he ended up there through extraordinary circumstances
- M-10: The nakedness and the matchstick are related to the same event — an escalating crisis
