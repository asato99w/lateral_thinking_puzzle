## P0: Anomalous Desert Death

### Step 1: Interpretation

A man died in the desert under bizarre circumstances. Conventional thinking: he was a lone individual who ended up in the desert, possibly through his own actions. The nakedness might be from heat, madness, or a crime. The matchstick is puzzling but probably an everyday object. The surface reader sees a mysterious death that defies easy explanation.

## P1: Group Emergency

### Step 1: Interpretation

The man was part of a group that faced a dangerous emergency. The clothes were removed for a practical reason during the crisis, not due to crime or madness. The man ended up alone because the group left the area (departed in a vehicle, or the man was separated). The matchstick is still not fully explained but is connected to an event within the group crisis.

## P2: Descent from Above

### Step 1: Interpretation

The man arrived at the desert from the air. He fell from a flying vehicle, which explains the absence of tracks and the death in a remote desert location. The vehicle continued without him (explaining its absence). Clothes were removed during the aerial crisis. The matchstick's precise role is not yet clear but is connected to the aerial event.

## P3: Chosen by Lot

### Step 1: Interpretation

The man was in a flying vehicle with companions. When the vehicle began losing altitude, they discarded cargo, then clothes. When that wasn't enough, they drew matches to decide who would jump. The man drew the short match and jumped to his death. The matchstick in his hand IS the losing lot.

## P4 (T): Hot Air Balloon Sacrifice

### Step 1: Interpretation

Complete truth: The man was riding in a hot air balloon with several companions. The balloon lost altitude over the desert. They first discarded all cargo, then removed their clothes — still not enough. They drew matches; the man drew the short one, and jumped to his death, saving the others.
