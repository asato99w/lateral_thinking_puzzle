# Paradigm Discovery

Application of A_深度階層型 to discover paradigm groups from F'.

## Step 1: Tension Structure

Key tensions in the descriptor space:

1. **Nakedness tension** (Fs-82, Fs-85): Why is the man naked in the desert? Desert conditions make nakedness dangerous, yet there's no sign of a struggle or crime.
2. **Desert location tension** (Fs-83): A dead man in the middle of the desert with no vehicle, tracks, or shelter. How did he get there?
3. **Matchstick tension** (Fs-84, Fs-87): Why is a dead man gripping a matchstick? A single matchstick is nearly useless in the desert. It must have symbolic or causal significance.
4. **Combined anomaly** (Fs-81, Fs-93): The triple combination of naked + desert + matchstick is deeply anomalous and cannot be explained by any single conventional scenario.
5. **Absence of tracks** (Fs-41, Fs-53): No transportation nearby implies an unusual mode of arrival.

## Step 2: Main Path Discovery

### P0: Surface Paradigm (「Anomalous Desert Death」)

Starting from Ps alone. The man died in the desert under bizarre circumstances. Common hypotheses:
- Lost traveler who died of exposure
- Victim of a crime
- Suicide
- Accident

**Interpretation**: A man died in the desert. His nakedness might be from madness, crime, or exposure. The matchstick is unexplained — perhaps he tried to light a fire. No single common explanation accounts for all facts simultaneously.

**Tensions resolved**: None — all 5 tensions remain.

**P_pred scope**: Ps, basic inferences from S (Fs-1 through Fs-14 selected), denial of complex explanations.

### P1: Group Crisis Paradigm (「Group Emergency」)

Deepening: The most accessible tension is the desert location (no tracks) and the nakedness. If we accept that the man arrived from elsewhere AND was part of a group in danger, several tensions begin to resolve.

**Interpretation**: The man was part of a group that faced an emergency. Clothes were removed under extreme duress (not due to crime or madness). The man ended up alone in the desert because the group departed. The matchstick connects to some decision or event within the group.

**Tensions resolved**:
- Nakedness tension: explained by crisis-driven clothing removal
- Desert location tension: partially resolved — the man was brought to the area, not walking

**Tensions remaining**:
- How the man arrived (aerial? vehicle?)
- Why the matchstick
- Exact cause of death
- Why the group left without him

**P_pred scope**: Accepts Fs-88 (external cause for nakedness), Fs-91 (others involved), M-1 (dangerous group situation), M-2 (sacrifices made). Denies solo explanations (Fs-10, Fs-55, Fs-56).

### P2: Aerial Arrival + Fall Paradigm (「Descent from Above」)

Deepening: If the man arrived from the air (explaining no tracks) and fell (explaining the desert body with no vehicle), the desert location tension is fully resolved.

**Interpretation**: The man was in an aircraft or flying vessel that experienced trouble. He fell or was ejected from the craft. The fall killed him. The nakedness is related to the crisis (e.g., weight reduction). The matchstick connects to an event during the crisis.

**Tensions resolved**:
- Desert location tension: fully resolved (aerial arrival + fall)
- Absence of tracks: fully resolved (arrived by air)
- Cause of death: partially resolved (fall)

**Tensions remaining**:
- Specific type of aircraft
- Precise role of the matchstick
- Why specifically a matchstick and not another object

**P_pred scope**: Accepts Ft-8 (arrived by air), M-4 (fell from height), D-1 (transported by air), D-4 (fell from height). Denies land-based arrival (Fs-44, Fs-55).

### P3: Lottery + Sacrifice Paradigm (「Chosen by Lot」)

Deepening: The matchstick tension is the last major tension. If the matchstick was part of a lottery or drawing (short straw), then the man was chosen to die — he jumped or was pushed to lighten the load of an aircraft.

**Interpretation**: The man was in a group airborne vehicle that was losing altitude. After discarding cargo and clothes, someone had to jump to save the rest. They drew matches (short match = loser). The man drew the short match and jumped. This resolves ALL tensions.

**Tensions resolved**:
- All tensions fully resolved
- Matchstick = losing lot in a life-or-death draw
- Nakedness = clothes discarded for weight
- Desert = fell from balloon
- Death = impact from fall
- No tracks = arrived by air

**P_pred scope**: Accepts most Ft descriptors. Denies alternative explanations. But does not yet specify the exact vehicle (hot air balloon) or all details.

### P4 (T): Full Truth (「Hot Air Balloon Sacrifice」)

The complete truth. Hot air balloon, specific sequence of events, match-drawing, short match, jump.

**P_pred scope**: All Pt descriptors and their derivatives. Complete explanation of all facts.

## Step 3: P_pred Scoping

### P0 scope
- Affirms: Ps-1~4, Fs-1, Fs-2, Fs-4, Fs-7, Fs-40, Fs-46, Fs-79, Fs-80, Fs-81
- Denies: Fs-88 (nakedness not from external crisis), Fs-91 (not group-related), Fs-69 (matchstick not a lottery)
- Residual error: P0 incorrectly predicts the man was alone (Fs-10=1), died of exposure or crime, and the matchstick is irrelevant or for fire.

### P1 scope
- Affirms: Ps-1~4, Fs-88, Fs-91, Fs-92, M-1, M-2, Fs-28, Fs-29, Fs-9, Fs-27, Fs-26
- Denies: Fs-10 (not alone), Fs-55 (not lost traveler), Fs-16 (not disease), Fs-17 (not heat stroke), Fs-38 (not madness)
- Residual error: P1 does not yet know aerial arrival, does not resolve the matchstick, may assume vehicle-based group (e.g., car breakdown)

### P2 scope
- Affirms: P1 scope + Ft-8, M-4, D-1, D-4, Fs-89, Fs-49, B-3, B-4
- Denies: Fs-44 (not land travel), Fs-55, Fs-58 (not regular vehicle crash), Fs-50 (not stranded traveler)
- Residual error: P2 does not know the matchstick's role. May assume parachute failure, ejection, etc.

### P3 scope
- Affirms: P2 scope + Fs-69, Fs-71, Fs-90, M-3, M-8, D-3, D-14, Ft-62, Ft-66, Ft-67, Ft-92, Ft-93, Ft-94
- Denies: Fs-76 (matchstick not for smoking), Fs-77 (not signaling), Fs-78 (not planted), Fs-70 (not for fire)
- Residual error: P3 may not know it's specifically a hot air balloon; may envision a plane or helicopter.

### P4 (T) scope
- Affirms: All Pt, most Ft, relevant D, B, M descriptors
- Denies: All false alternative hypotheses

### Residual error confirmation
- P0: incorrectly predicts Fs-10=1 (alone), Fs-17=1 (heat stroke possible), etc. → anomalies present ✓
- P1: incorrectly predicts the group was on the ground → anomalies present ✓
- P2: incorrectly denies matchstick significance as a lottery → anomalies present ✓
- P3: lacks specification of balloon → anomalies present ✓

## Step 4: Sub-path Discovery

### S1: Crime/Murder Paradigm (「Desert Crime」)

Branches from P0. Interprets the scene as a murder — the man was killed elsewhere and dumped in the desert, or killed in the desert. Clothes removed to eliminate evidence.

- Affirms: Fs-11, Fs-15, Fs-30, Fs-32
- Denies: Fs-31 (not voluntary removal), Fs-88

Eventually fails because the matchstick gripped in hand and the specific desert location contradict typical crime scenarios.

### S2: Lost Explorer Paradigm (「Desert Survival」)

Branches from P0. The man was a desert explorer or traveler who got lost. Removed clothes due to heat delirium. The matchstick was his last attempt to start a fire for rescue.

- Affirms: Fs-55, Fs-17, Fs-38, Fs-70, Fs-77
- Denies: Fs-91, Fs-88

Fails because the man was found in the MIDDLE of the desert with no tracks or equipment, and the single matchstick (not a box) is too specific.

## Step 5: Reachability Verification

| Paradigm | Approx. anomaly count vs T | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | ~15 | Highest |
| P1 | ~10 | ↓ |
| P2 | ~6 | ↓ |
| P3 | ~3 | ↓ |
| P4 | 0 | T |

Anomaly count decreases along the main path ✓
