## S (Problem Statement)

A man walks into a restaurant and orders turtle soup. After taking one sip, he asks the waiter, "Is this really turtle soup?" The waiter replies, "Yes, it is indeed turtle soup." That night, the man kills himself. Why?

## T (Truth)

The man was once shipwrecked with several companions. When their food ran out, one of the companions died. The survivors told the man they had made "turtle soup" and gave it to him to eat. In reality, the soup was made from the flesh of the dead companion. Years later, when the man tasted real turtle soup at the restaurant, he realized the flavor was completely different from what he had been given on the island. He understood that what he had eaten was human flesh — the meat of his dead companion. Overwhelmed by horror and despair, he killed himself that night.
