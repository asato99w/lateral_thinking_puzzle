| Fs-15 | 否定代替仮説 (背景) | He might be a regular customer visiting for ordinary reasons (T reveals his visit connects to a traumatic past) |
| Fs-16 | 異常性検出 | No anomaly detected in this descriptor alone; entering a restaurant is normal behavior |

### Ps-2: He orders turtle soup

| ID | Rule | Content |
|----|------|---------|
| Fs-17 | 前提抽出 | Turtle soup is on the menu |
| Fs-18 | 前提抽出 | The man knows what turtle soup is (or at least the name) |
| Fs-19 | 5W1H (Who) | The man himself orders (not someone else for him) |
| Fs-20 | 5W1H (What) | Turtle soup specifically, not any other dish |

| Fs-32 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | His choice might be random or preference-based (T reveals it connects to a traumatic experience) |
| Fs-33 | 異常性検出 | The specific choice of turtle soup is potentially significant; choosing a specific dish can indicate an investigative purpose |

### Ps-3: He takes one sip

| ID | Rule | Content |
|----|------|---------|
| Fs-34 | 前提抽出 | The soup has been served to him |
| Fs-35 | 5W1H (Who) | The man himself tastes it |
| Fs-36 | 5W1H (What) | Only one sip — a minimal taste, not a full meal |
| Fs-37 | 5W1H (When) | Immediately after being served |
| Fs-38 | 5W1H (Where) | At the restaurant table |

| Fs-45 | 感情推論 | The sip may have triggered shock, realization, or strong emotional response |
| Fs-46 | 対比生成 | A normal diner would continue eating; stopping at one sip is unusual |
| Fs-47 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | He might stop because the soup tastes bad / he's not hungry / it's too hot (T reveals he stopped because the taste was different from what he remembered) |
| Fs-48 | 否定代替仮説 (動機) | He might stop due to health concerns or allergic reaction (T denies these) |
| Fs-49 | 異常性検出 | Taking only one sip is anomalous — it suggests the purpose was verification, not consumption |

### Ps-4: He asks the waiter "Is this really turtle soup?"

| ID | Rule | Content |
|----|------|---------|
| Fs-50 | 前提抽出 | He doubts the identity of the soup |
| Fs-51 | 前提抽出 | The question implies he has a basis for comparison |
| Fs-52 | 5W1H (Who) | He asks the waiter, the authority on the food being served |
| Fs-53 | 5W1H (What) | He questions the authenticity of the turtle soup |

| Fs-60 | 含意導出 | This difference is significant enough to prompt a question |
| Fs-61 | 因果逆推 | A past experience gave him a different impression of turtle soup's taste |
| Fs-62 | 状況仮説 | He once ate something labeled "turtle soup" that tasted different from this |
| Fs-63 | 感情推論 | Anxiety, suspicion, or dawning horror may underlie this question |
| Fs-64 | 対比生成 | A normal diner who dislikes the taste would complain about quality, not question authenticity |
| Fs-65 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | He might question it because the soup looks wrong / has unusual texture / smells strange (T reveals the taste difference from his island experience is the reason) |
| Fs-66 | 否定代替仮説 (関与者) | Someone else might have told him the soup is not authentic (T denies external influence — it's his own taste memory) |
| Fs-67 | 異常性検出 | Questioning the authenticity of a dish after one sip is anomalous — normal diners don't do this unless they have a specific basis for comparison |
| Fs-68 | 異常性検出 | The question focuses on identity ("Is this really..."), not quality ("Is this good...") — a diagnostic rather than evaluative question |

### Ps-5: The waiter confirms it is turtle soup

| ID | Rule | Content |

| Fs-69 | 前提抽出 | The waiter has knowledge of what was served |
| Fs-70 | 前提抽出 | The waiter is telling the truth |

| Fs-74 | 5W1H (Where) | At the restaurant |
| Fs-75 | 5W1H (Why) | The waiter has no reason to lie; the restaurant's honesty is not relevant to T |
| Fs-76 | 5W1H (How) | Verbal confirmation |
| Fs-77 | 含意導出 | The soup the man is eating IS real turtle soup |
| Fs-78 | 含意導出 | Therefore, his prior "turtle soup" was NOT real turtle soup |
| Fs-79 | 含意導出 | The man now has proof that his previous experience was a deception |
| Fs-80 | 因果逆推 | The confirmation provides the final evidence for the man's realization |
| Fs-81 | 状況仮説 | The waiter's honest answer unwittingly triggers a devastating realization |
| Fs-82 | 感情推論 | The confirmation triggers horror as the implication becomes clear |
| Fs-83 | 対比生成 | If the waiter had said "no, it's not real turtle soup," the outcome might have been different |
| Fs-84 | 否定代替仮説 (関与者) | The waiter might be lying or mistaken (T confirms the waiter is truthful) |
| Fs-85 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | The confirmation might reassure the man (T reveals the opposite — it confirms his worst fear) |
| Fs-86 | 異常性検出 | The confirmation itself is not anomalous, but its devastating psychological effect on the man is |

### Ps-6: The man kills himself that night

| ID | Rule | Content |
|----|------|---------|
| Fs-87 | 前提抽出 | The man made a deliberate decision to end his life |
| Fs-88 | 前提抽出 | Something at the restaurant triggered this decision |
| Fs-89 | 5W1H (Who) | The man himself takes his own life |
| Fs-90 | 5W1H (What) | Suicide — the most extreme response possible |
| Fs-91 | 5W1H (When) | That same night — the immediacy suggests the trigger was at the restaurant |
| Fs-92 | 5W1H (Where) | The location of the suicide is not specified and is not relevant to T |
| Fs-93 | 5W1H (Why) | The reason for suicide is the central mystery of the puzzle |
| Fs-94 | 5W1H (How) | The method of suicide is not specified and is not relevant to T |

| Fs-96 | 含意導出 | The distress was so severe that he saw no alternative to death |
| Fs-97 | 因果逆推 | Something learned or confirmed at the restaurant made living intolerable |
| Fs-98 | 状況仮説 | A devastating truth was revealed during the restaurant visit |
| Fs-99 | 感情推論 | The man experienced extreme horror, guilt, disgust, or despair |
| Fs-100 | 感情推論 | The emotional burden was beyond his capacity to bear |
| Fs-101 | 対比生成 | A normal dining experience does not lead to suicide — the cause must be extraordinary |
| Fs-102 | 否定代替仮説 (動機) | He might kill himself due to romantic problems / financial ruin / terminal illness / legal trouble (all denied by T — it's connected to the turtle soup revelation) |
| Fs-103 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | Something else that night, unrelated to the restaurant, might have triggered the suicide (T confirms the restaurant experience was the direct cause) |
| Fs-104 | 否定代替仮説 (背景) | Past trauma from war / crime / abuse might be the underlying cause (T specifies the shipwreck and cannibalism) |
| Fs-105 | 異常性検出 | Suicide after a restaurant visit is extremely anomalous — an extraordinary causal chain must exist between dining and death |

### 緊張関係抽出 (Ps pairs)

| ID | Pair | Content |
|----|------|---------|
| Fs-106 | Ps-2 × Ps-4 | He ordered turtle soup yet questioned its authenticity — this tension implies he had a prior reference point for comparison and his ordering was not casual |
| Fs-107 | Ps-3 × Ps-4 | One sip was enough to trigger the question — the taste itself carried critical information, and the question followed immediately |
| Fs-108 | Ps-5 × Ps-6 | Confirming it IS real turtle soup led to suicide — knowing the truth about the soup destroyed him. How can confirming something is genuine lead to death? |
| Fs-109 | Ps-2 × Ps-6 | Ordering turtle soup eventually led to suicide — the choice of dish is causally connected to death |
| Fs-110 | Ps-4 × Ps-6 | Questioning the soup's authenticity is connected to the suicide — the answer to his question was part of the fatal chain |
| Fs-111 | Ps-1 × Ps-6 | Entering a restaurant led to suicide — the visit itself was the beginning of the fatal chain |
| Fs-112 | Ps-3 × Ps-6 | The single sip set in motion the chain ending in death |
| Fs-113 | Ps-4 × Ps-5 | The man's question and the waiter's confirmation form a Q&A that resolves doubt — but the resolution is devastating rather than reassuring |
| Fs-114 | Ps-1 × Ps-3 | He entered to eat but stopped at one sip — the visit's purpose shifted from consumption to investigation |
| Fs-115 | Ps-2 × Ps-3 | He ordered turtle soup but barely consumed it — the purpose was verification, not eating |

| Ft-57 | 含意導出 | The survivors believed the truth would be unbearable for the man |
| Ft-58 | 因果逆推 | The survivors decided collectively to deceive the man — they knew the truth |
| Ft-59 | 状況仮説 | Some survivors may have eaten knowingly while protecting the man from the truth |
| Ft-60 | 感情推論 | The survivors who lied may have felt guilt, compassion, and pragmatic necessity |
| Ft-61 | 対比生成 | If they had told the truth, the man might have refused to eat and died |
| Ft-62 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | They might have genuinely found a turtle on the island (T denies this) |
| Ft-63 | 隠蔽動機推論 | The deception reveals that the true ingredient is something socially and morally unacceptable |
| Ft-64 | 隠蔽動機推論 | The need to hide suggests the man would rather starve than knowingly eat human flesh |
| Ft-65 | 隠蔽動機推論 | The specific choice of "turtle soup" as cover suggests plausibility was considered |

### Pt-5: He ate the soup believing it was turtle soup

| ID | Rule | Content |
|----|------|---------|

| Ft-67 | 前提抽出 | The deception was successful |

| Ft-73 | 5W1H (How) | By eating normally, without suspicion |
| Ft-74 | 含意導出 | The man formed a taste memory of this "turtle soup" |
| Ft-75 | 含意導出 | This taste memory became his reference point for what turtle soup tastes like |
| Ft-76 | 因果逆推 | His trust in his companions made the deception complete |
| Ft-77 | 状況仮説 | The man carried this false taste memory for years until the restaurant visit |

| Ft-93 | 感情推論 | Upon discovery, horror, disgust, violation, and despair would overwhelm the man |
| Ft-94 | 対比生成 | If actual turtle or another animal had been available, none of this would have happened |
| Ft-95 | 否定代替仮説 (手段) | The soup might have been made from another animal found on the island (T confirms it was human flesh) |
| Ft-96 | 隠蔽動機推論 | The true material is human flesh — a substance that violates the most fundamental social and moral taboos |
| Ft-97 | 隠蔽動機推論 | The concealment was total because the truth would make the act of eating psychologically impossible |

### Pt-7: At the restaurant, the real turtle soup tasted different

| ID | Rule | Content |

| Ft-106 | 5W1H (How) | Through direct sensory comparison (taste) |
| Ft-107 | 含意導出 | The taste difference proves the island soup was not turtle soup |
| Ft-108 | 含意導出 | This sensory evidence is irrefutable to the man |
| Ft-109 | 因果逆推 | The island soup tasted different because it was made from different material (human flesh) |
| Ft-110 | 状況仮説 | The man may have visited the restaurant specifically to test this comparison |
| Ft-111 | 感情推論 | The taste difference triggers a cascade of dread and dawning realization |
| Ft-112 | 対比生成 | If the tastes had been the same, the man would have been reassured and left unharmed |
| Ft-113 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | The taste difference might be due to recipe variation or regional cooking methods (T reveals the fundamental reason: different base ingredient) |

| Ft-123 | 含意導出 | He had violated the most fundamental human taboo unknowingly |
| Ft-124 | 含意導出 | His entire memory of the island experience is reframed in horror |
| Ft-125 | 因果逆推 | The realization is the direct cause of his subsequent suicide |
| Ft-126 | 状況仮説 | The full weight of the truth crashes upon him in that moment |
| Ft-127 | 感情推論 | Overwhelming horror, disgust, betrayal, self-revulsion, despair |
| Ft-128 | 対比生成 | If he had never tasted real turtle soup, he might have lived in blissful ignorance |
| Ft-129 | 否定代替仮説 (因果) | He might reach a different conclusion — e.g., the companions used a different animal (T confirms his conclusion was correct) |

|----|------|---------|
| Ft-130 | 前提抽出 | The realization was psychologically unbearable |
| Ft-131 | 前提抽出 | He saw no way to live with this knowledge |

| Ft-136 | 5W1H (Why) | Horror at having eaten human flesh + betrayal + self-revulsion |
| Ft-137 | 5W1H (How) | Not specified, not relevant to T |
| Ft-138 | 含意導出 | The knowledge of unwitting cannibalism is presented as a burden too great to bear |
| Ft-139 | 含意導出 | The man valued his moral self-image more than life itself |
| Ft-140 | 因果逆推 | The combination of horror, disgust, and betrayal exceeded his psychological capacity |
| Ft-141 | 状況仮説 | The man may have tried to process the information but found no way to reconcile it with his self-image |
| Ft-142 | 感情推論 | Total despair, loss of identity, inability to face the world or himself |
| Ft-143 | 対比生成 | Some people might find ways to cope; the man's suicide indicates the depth of his horror |
| Ft-144 | 否定代替仮説 (動機) | Other reasons for suicide after a restaurant visit: food poisoning fear, receiving devastating news by phone (T specifies the cannibalism realization) |

## E1 Step 4: 合成 (cross-set synthesis)

Combining descriptors across all sets (Ps ∪ Fs₁ ∪ Fs₂ ∪ Pt ∪ Ft₁ ∪ Ft₂) to derive new descriptors.

### Fs × Ft synthesis

| ID | Sources | Content |
|----|---------|---------|
| D-1 | Fs-23, Ft-74 | The man ordered turtle soup specifically to compare it with his stored taste memory from the island — the visit was an investigative act |
| D-2 | Fs-59, Ft-107 | The sensory discrepancy between restaurant and island soup is the key evidence revealing the deception |
| D-3 | Fs-78, Ft-89 | The confirmation that real turtle soup tastes different proves the man ate human flesh, not turtle soup |
| D-4 | Fs-95, Ft-125 | The restaurant visit triggered the revelation that destroyed him psychologically |
| D-5 | Fs-49, Ft-110 | The entire restaurant visit — from entry to ordering to tasting — was a deliberate verification mission |
| D-6 | Fs-101, Ft-146 | The extraordinary connection between dining and death is explained by the discovery of cannibalism — a violation beyond normal psychological endurance |
| D-7 | Fs-82, Ft-127 | The waiter's innocent confirmation serves as the final evidence that transforms suspicion into certainty, triggering devastating emotional collapse |
| D-8 | Fs-78, Ft-65 | The "turtle soup" label served as both the deception on the island and the mechanism of truth at the restaurant |
| D-9 | Fs-13, Ft-110 | He chose a restaurant over eating at home because a restaurant is an authoritative source for verifying what real turtle soup tastes like |

### Fs × Fs synthesis

| ID | Sources | Content |
|----|---------|---------|
| D-10 | Fs-25, Fs-61 | His interest in turtle soup is rooted in a specific past experience that created a conflicting taste memory |
| D-11 | Fs-46, Fs-67 | The sequence of one sip followed by authenticity questioning reveals a pre-planned investigation |
| D-12 | Fs-108, Fs-105 | The puzzle's core paradox: an honest answer to an ordinary question leads to death |

### Ft × Ft synthesis

| ID | Sources | Content |
|----|---------|---------|
| D-13 | Ft-48, Ft-64 | The deception was motivated by the knowledge that the truth would prevent the man from eating and thus surviving |
| D-14 | Ft-74, Ft-107 | The taste memory from the island became a time-delayed evidence mechanism — the means through which the truth would eventually emerge |
| D-15 | Ft-89, Ft-139 | The man's strong moral identity made the discovery of his unwitting cannibalism existentially unbearable |
| D-16 | Ft-12, Ft-27 | The shipwreck and starvation together created the preconditions for the taboo act |

### Abstracted synthesis

| ID | Sources | Content |
|----|---------|---------|
| D-17 | Fs-124, Ft-148 | The puzzle explores how concealed truth, once revealed, can destroy — knowledge itself can be lethal |
| D-18 | Fs-117, Ft-156 | Both the man's restaurant visit and his companions' past actions have hidden purposes — the entire narrative is structured around concealed intent |
| D-19 | Fs-119, Ft-152 | The apparently ordinary events in S are extraordinary because they are connected to extreme past circumstances |
