# Question Structure Design

Rules: 質問構造設計アルゴリズム, 関係構造の構成 Rule 5

## Step 1: Anomaly Targets

### P0 (Surface)

Anomaly descriptors (P_pred ≠ T):
- Fs-14=1 (ordinary motive) → T says 0
- Fs-15=1 (ordinary visit) → T says 0
- Fs-31=1 (random preference) → T says 0
- Fs-102=1 (suicide from other causes) → T says 0
- Fs-103=1 (unrelated to restaurant) → T says 0

Target: 3+ anomaly introduction questions to accumulate tension for shift to P1.

### P1 (Past Connection)

Anomaly descriptors (P_pred ≠ T):
- Fs-47=1 (stopped because bad taste) → T says 0
- Fs-65=1 (questioned because looks wrong) → T says 0
- Fs-102=1 (suicide from other causes) → T says 0

Target: 2+ anomaly introduction questions for shift to P2.

### P2 (Taste Discrepancy)

Anomaly descriptors (P_pred ≠ T):
- Ft-62=1 (genuinely found turtle on island) → T says 0
- Fs-102=1 (suicide from other causes) → T says 0

Target: 2+ anomaly introduction questions for shift to P3.

### P3 (Taboo Discovery)

Anomaly descriptors (P_pred ≠ T):
- Ft-46=1 (companion killed deliberately) → T says 0 (uncertain/natural death)
- Ft-17=1 (traumatic past was war/crime) → T says 0 (shipwreck)

Target: 1+ anomaly introduction questions for shift to T.

## Step 2: Cognitive Reach Paths (reverse design)

### Path to P0 anomalies

**Target anomaly**: "The suicide IS related to the turtle soup" (denies Fs-103)
- Reverse step: Player must first observe the man's unusual behavior with the soup
- Reverse step: Player asks about whether the soup matters → learns it does
- Layer 0: "Is the reason for death related to the restaurant visit?" (no prerequisite)

**Target anomaly**: "The man's motive was NOT ordinary" (denies Fs-14)
- Reverse step: Player discovers the visit had a purpose
- Layer 0: "Did the man come to the restaurant for a specific purpose?" (no prerequisite)

### Path to P1 anomalies

**Target anomaly**: "The man didn't stop because of bad taste" (denies Fs-47)
- Reverse: Player must know the man had a past connection (P1 established)
- Prerequisite: Fs-27 (past connection established)
- Layer 1: "Was the man comparing the taste to a memory?" (prereq: Fs-27)

**Target anomaly**: "Suicide relates to what he learned about the soup" (denies Fs-102)
- Reverse: Must know the taste comparison was significant
- Prerequisite: Fs-59 (taste differed)
- Layer 1: "Did the taste reveal something disturbing?" (prereq: Fs-59)

### Path to P2 anomalies

**Target anomaly**: "The prior food was NOT actually turtle" (denies Ft-62)
- Reverse: Must know someone lied about the food
- Prerequisite: Fs-78 (prior soup was NOT real turtle soup)
- Layer 2: "Was the man lied to about what he was eating?" (prereq: Fs-78)

### Path to P3 anomalies

**Target anomaly**: "It was a shipwreck, not war/crime" (denies Ft-17)
- Reverse: Must know about extreme circumstances
- Prerequisite: Ft-152 (extreme circumstances)
- Layer 3: "Was the man stranded at sea?" (prereq: Ft-152)

## Step 3: Layer Structure

### P0 layers
- **Layer 0**: Basic exploration questions (no prerequisites). Questions about the restaurant, the man, the soup.
- **Layer 1**: Questions unlocked by initial discoveries (prereqs from layer 0 answers).

### P1 layers
- **Layer 0**: Questions about the man's past connection (no prereqs within P1, but P1 must be current paradigm).
- **Layer 1**: Questions about the nature of the past experience.

### P2 layers
- **Layer 0**: Questions about the taste comparison and deception (basic within P2).
- **Layer 1**: Questions about what the deceptive food actually was.

### P3 layers
- **Layer 0**: Questions about the survival situation.
- **Layer 1**: Questions about the specific circumstances (shipwreck, death, flesh).

### Gate edges (to be added to R(P))

| Paradigm | Source | Target | Weight | Purpose |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| P0 | Fs-88 (restaurant triggered) | Fs-27 (past connection) | 0.7 | Gate to P1-level questions |
| P1 | Fs-27 (past connection) | Fs-59 (taste differed) | 0.7 | Gate to taste comparison |
| P1 | Fs-59 (taste differed) | Fs-78 (not real) | 0.7 | Gate to deception discovery |
| P2 | Fs-78 (not real) | Ft-63 (morally unacceptable) | 0.7 | Gate to taboo realm |
| P3 | Ft-63 (morally unacceptable) | Ft-84 (cannibalism) | 0.7 | Gate to specific truth |

## Step 4: Material Shortage Check

No critical shortages detected. The descriptor space from E1 provides sufficient intermediate descriptors for all designed cognitive paths.

Minor note: The path from "extreme circumstances" to "shipwreck" could benefit from an intermediate descriptor about "being stranded" or "survival at sea." Ft-151 (separated from normal social structures) serves this role adequately.
