## Step 1: Tension Structure

Key tensions identified from Fs₁ (緊張関係抽出):

| ID | Tension | Severity |
|----|---------|----------|
| Fs-106 | He ordered turtle soup yet questioned its authenticity — implies a prior reference point | Moderate |
| Fs-107 | One sip triggered the question — taste carried critical information | Moderate |
| Fs-108 | Confirmation that it IS real turtle soup led to suicide — central paradox | Critical |
| Fs-109 | Ordering turtle soup is causally connected to death | High |
| Fs-114 | Entered to eat but stopped at one sip — purpose shifted from consumption to investigation | Moderate |
| Fs-115 | Ordered but barely consumed — verification, not eating | Moderate |

Additional tensions from 異常性検出:

| ID | Anomaly | Severity |
|----|---------|----------|
| Fs-49 | One sip is anomalous — suggests verification purpose | Moderate |
| Fs-67 | Questioning authenticity after one sip is anomalous | Moderate |
| Fs-68 | Question focuses on identity, not quality — diagnostic, not evaluative | Moderate |
| Fs-105 | Suicide after a restaurant visit is extremely anomalous | Critical |

These tensions form the gradient that the paradigm path must progressively resolve.

## Step 2: Main Path

### P0: Surface Paradigm (Division I)

**Interpretation**: The man went to a restaurant, ordered turtle soup, tasted it, asked about it, and killed himself that night. There is no apparent connection between dining and death; the suicide might be coincidental or triggered by something else at the restaurant (bad news, meeting someone, etc.).

**Tensions resolved**: None. All tensions remain open.

**Tensions unresolved**: Fs-106, Fs-107, Fs-108, Fs-109, Fs-114, Fs-115, Fs-49, Fs-67, Fs-68, Fs-105.

### P1: Past Connection (Division I)

**Interpretation**: The man has a specific personal connection to turtle soup from his past. He did not come to the restaurant for an ordinary meal — he came specifically to eat turtle soup for a reason rooted in his history. The choice of dish was deliberate and meaningful.

**Tensions resolved**:
- Fs-106 (ordered yet questioned → he has a prior reference point): Resolved. He came because of a past connection to "turtle soup."
- Fs-115 (ordered but barely consumed): Partially resolved. The purpose was not ordinary consumption.

**Tensions unresolved**: Fs-107, Fs-108, Fs-49, Fs-67, Fs-68, Fs-105 (why one sip? why question identity? why suicide?).

**Key new understanding**: The restaurant visit has a purpose beyond eating.

### P2: Taste Discrepancy (Division I → II border)

**Interpretation**: The man previously ate something labeled "turtle soup" that tasted completely different from what he is now eating at the restaurant. One sip was enough for him to recognize the discrepancy. His question to the waiter was diagnostic: he needed to confirm that what the restaurant served is genuine turtle soup, because if it is, then what he ate in the past was NOT turtle soup — it was something else entirely. Someone in his past deceived him about the identity of the food he was given.

**Tensions resolved**:
- Fs-107 (one sip triggered the question): Resolved. The taste comparison was immediate and decisive.
- Fs-49 (one sip anomalous): Resolved. The purpose was sensory verification.
- Fs-67 (questioning authenticity anomalous): Resolved. He has a specific basis for comparison.
- Fs-68 (identity question, not quality): Resolved. He is diagnosing identity, not evaluating taste.
- Fs-114 (consumption → investigation): Resolved. The visit was investigative from the start.

**Tensions unresolved**: Fs-108 (confirmation → suicide), Fs-105 (suicide after restaurant). Why is the discovery that his past "turtle soup" was fake so devastating that it leads to death?

**Key new understanding**: Past deception is confirmed; the prior "turtle soup" was a lie. But this alone — discovering that you once ate mislabeled food — does not explain suicide.

### P3: Taboo Discovery (Division II → III)

**Interpretation**: The substance he was previously given under the false label of "turtle soup" was not merely a different food — it was something deeply disturbing, something that violates fundamental moral or social taboos. The deception was not trivial mislabeling but a desperate concealment of something unspeakable. The discovery of what he actually consumed was so horrifying that death seemed preferable to living with that knowledge.

**Tensions resolved**:
- Fs-108 (confirmation → suicide): Resolved. Knowing the restaurant soup is real turtle soup proves that the island "soup" was made from something else — something terrible enough to drive a man to suicide.
- Fs-105 (suicide after restaurant): Resolved. The extraordinary causal chain is: taste comparison → proof of deception → realization of what was actually consumed → psychological devastation → suicide.
- Fs-109 (turtle soup → death): Resolved. The specific dish is the key that unlocks the devastating truth.

**Tensions unresolved**: What exactly was the substance? What were the circumstances? Who deceived him and why?

**Key new understanding**: Enters Ft territory. The food was morally forbidden. The deception was a survival act, not malice. But the specific scenario remains unknown.

### P4 = T: Full Truth (Division III)

**Interpretation**: The man was once shipwrecked with companions. When food ran out and one companion died, the survivors prepared a soup from the dead companion's flesh and told the man it was "turtle soup." He ate it unknowingly. Years later, at the restaurant, the taste of real turtle soup was completely different from his island memory. The waiter's confirmation that it was genuine turtle soup proved that what he ate on the island was human flesh — the meat of his dead companion. Overwhelmed by horror and despair, he killed himself.

**All tensions resolved.**

## Step 3: P_pred Scoping

### P0 — Surface

P_pred(P0) scope: Ps descriptors + basic common-sense inferences.

| Descriptor | P_pred | O* | Match |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------|
| Ps-1 to Ps-6 | 1 (all true) | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-4 (restaurant for dining) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-9 (expected a meal) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive for visit) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Fs-15 (regular customer / ordinary reasons) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Fs-31 (random preference-based order) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Fs-47 (stopped because soup tastes bad) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Fs-102 (suicide due to romantic/financial problems) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Fs-103 (unrelated cause of suicide) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |

Residual errors confirmed: P0 predicts ordinary dining motives, random soup choice, and unrelated suicide cause — all contradicted by T.

### P1 — Past Connection

P_pred(P1) scope: P0 scope + past connection to turtle soup.

| Descriptor | P_pred | O* | Match |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------|
| Fs-25 (specific interest in turtle soup) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-27 (past connection to turtle soup) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-28 (wants to taste again/verify) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-116 (hidden purpose beyond eating) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive) | 0 | 0 | ✓ (resolved) |
| Fs-31 (random order) | 0 | 0 | ✓ (resolved) |
| Fs-47 (stopped because bad taste) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Fs-102 (suicide due to other causes) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Fs-65 (questioned because looks/smells wrong) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |

Residual errors confirmed: P1 still predicts common-sense explanations for stopping and for the suicide.

### P2 — Taste Discrepancy

P_pred(P2) scope: P1 scope + taste comparison + past deception.

| Descriptor | P_pred | O* | Match |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------|
| Fs-51 (has basis for comparison) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-58 (prior expectation of turtle soup taste) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-59 (actual taste differed from prior experience) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-62 (once ate something labeled "turtle soup" that tasted different) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-78 (prior "turtle soup" was NOT real) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-79 (proof of past deception) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| D-2 (sensory discrepancy is key evidence) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| D-5 (visit was verification mission) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-47 (stopped because bad taste) | 0 | 0 | ✓ (resolved) |
| Fs-65 (questioned because looks wrong) | 0 | 0 | ✓ (resolved) |
| Fs-102 (suicide due to other causes) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly) |
| Ft-62 (genuinely found turtle on island) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly — P2 doesn't know what the food was) |

Residual errors confirmed: P2 doesn't know what the deceptive food actually was, nor the circumstances of the deception. It may default to assuming the food was a different animal or a prank, which T denies.

### P3 — Taboo Discovery

P_pred(P3) scope: P2 scope + taboo nature of the food + survival context.

| Descriptor | P_pred | O* | Match |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------|
| Ft-63 (food was morally unacceptable) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Ft-64 (man would refuse if he knew) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Ft-146 (fundamental norm violated) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Ft-148 (devastating secret) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Ft-150 (deceived into violating moral standards) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Ft-152 (extreme circumstances altered moral calculus) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| D-6 (dining→death explained by taboo violation) | 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Fs-102 (suicide due to other causes) | 0 | 0 | ✓ (resolved) |
| Ft-62 (genuinely found turtle) | 0 | 0 | ✓ (resolved) |
| Ft-46 (companion killed deliberately) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly — P3 doesn't know details) |
| Ft-17 (traumatic past was war/disaster) | 1 | 0 | ✗ (anomaly — doesn't know it was shipwreck) |

Residual errors confirmed: P3 doesn't know the specific scenario (shipwreck vs. war vs. other), nor whether the death was natural vs. deliberate.

### P4 = T

P_pred(T) scope: All descriptors in F.

All predictions match O*. No anomalies. Anomaly count = 0.

## Step 4: Sub-paths

### Sub-path S1: Poisoning Theory (branches from P0)

**Interpretation**: The soup was poisoned, or the man discovered the restaurant was serving something dangerous. He kills himself out of fear or to prevent a worse death.

**Branching point**: P0 → S1 (alternative to P1)
**Resolution**: This paradigm resolves Fs-105 (suicide after restaurant) partially but fails to resolve Fs-106 (why he questioned authenticity) and Fs-107 (why one sip was diagnostic). It converges back toward P1 when the player discovers the man's past connection.

P_pred(S1):
- Fs-47 (bad/dangerous taste) → 1 (but O* = 0, anomaly)
- Fs-85 (confirmation reassures) → 1 (but O* = 0, anomaly — confirmation triggered horror, not relief)

### Sub-path S2: Prior Knowledge Theory (branches from P1)

**Interpretation**: The man had prior knowledge that the restaurant was fraudulent or dangerous, and came to test it. A kind of investigative journalism or personal vendetta.

**Branching point**: P1 → S2 (alternative to P2)
**Resolution**: Resolves the investigative behavior but fails to explain why confirmation of authenticity leads to despair. Converges toward P2 when the player discovers the man's own past deception.

P_pred(S2):
- Fs-84 (waiter might be lying) → 1 (but O* = 0, anomaly — waiter was truthful)
- Fs-85 (confirmation brings relief or justice) → 1 (but O* = 0, anomaly)

### Sub-path S3: Guilt from Past Crime (branches from P2)

**Interpretation**: The man was involved in something criminal in the past where "turtle soup" was a code word or involved. Discovering real turtle soup triggers guilt about the past crime.

**Branching point**: P2 → S3 (alternative to P3)
**Resolution**: Resolves the devastating emotional impact but introduces anomalies when the player discovers it's about food and deception, not crime. Converges toward P3.

P_pred(S3):
- Fs-104 (past trauma from crime) → 1 (but O* = 0, anomaly — T specifies shipwreck)
- Ft-17 (traumatic past was war/crime) → 1 (but O* = 0, anomaly)

## Step 5: Reachability Verification

### Anomaly count estimates (at O*)

| Paradigm | Anomaly Count (est.) | Depth |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| P0 | ~6 | 0 |
| P1 | ~4 | 1 |
| P2 | ~2 | 2 |
| P3 | ~2 | 3 |
| T (P4) | 0 | 4 |
| S1 | ~5 | 0-1 |
| S2 | ~3 | 1-2 |
| S3 | ~2 | 2-3 |

### Verification

1. **All non-terminal paradigms have non-zero anomaly count**: ✓ (P0: ~6, P1: ~4, P2: ~2, P3: ~2)
2. **Anomaly count decreases along main path**: ✓ (6 → 4 → 2 → 2 → 0)
3. **Sub-path anomaly counts**: S1 (~5) > P1 (~4); S2 (~3) > P2 (~2); S3 (~2) ≈ P3 (~2). Sub-paths do not resolve tensions more efficiently than the main path.

Note: P2 and P3 have similar anomaly counts (~2 each). The transition from P2 to P3 is driven by qualitative change (entering Ft territory) rather than large quantitative anomaly reduction. The Division I→III transition represents a categorical shift in the type of unresolved tensions.

### Main Path Summary

  Division I         Division I          Division I/II          Division II/III      Division III
```

### Sub-path Summary

```
