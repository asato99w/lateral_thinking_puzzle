## P0: Surface Paradigm

### Step 1: Interpretation

A man went to a restaurant for an ordinary meal. He ordered turtle soup as a matter of preference or curiosity. After one sip he was dissatisfied and questioned whether it was genuine. The waiter confirmed it was. That night, the man killed himself for reasons unrelated to the dining experience — perhaps personal troubles (romantic, financial, or medical).

### Step 2: P_pred(d)=1

| Descriptor | Justification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Ps-1 to Ps-6 | Direct observation |
| Fs-1 (alive and mobile) | Premise of entering |
| Fs-2 (restaurant open) | Premise of entering |
| Fs-4 (restaurant for dining) | Core of P0 interpretation |
| Fs-9 (expected a meal) | Natural consequence of entering |
| Fs-13 (chose restaurant over eating at home) | Observation |
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive) | P0's central assumption |
| Fs-15 (ordinary visit) | P0's central assumption |
| Fs-31 (preference-based order) | P0 default |
| Fs-34 (soup served) | Premise of sipping |
| Fs-69 (waiter knows what was served) | Common assumption |
| Fs-70 (waiter tells truth) | Common assumption |
| Fs-77 (IS real turtle soup) | Waiter's confirmation |
| Fs-87 (deliberate suicide) | From Ps-6 |
| Fs-102 (suicide due to other causes) | P0's explanation of death |
| Fs-103 (unrelated to restaurant) | P0's explanation |

### Step 3: P_pred(d)=0

| Descriptor | Justification | Ground (P_pred=1) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Fs-116 (hidden purpose) | Ordinary visit has no hidden purpose | Fs-14 |
| D-5 (verification mission) | No investigative intent assumed | Fs-14 |
| Fs-27 (past connection to turtle soup) | No special history assumed | Fs-31 |
| Fs-25 (specific interest) | Treated as random preference | Fs-31 |
| Fs-51 (basis for comparison) | No prior turtle soup experience assumed | Fs-31 |
| Fs-88 (restaurant triggered suicide) | Suicide is unrelated | Fs-103 |
| Fs-95 (restaurant caused unbearable distress) | No distress from restaurant | Fs-103 |

Many Ft descriptors (Ft-1 through Ft-158) are **不定** — P0's world does not consider the man's deep past or any connection between the food and his death.

### Step 4: R(P0)

| Source | Target | Weight | Rule | Type |
|--------|--------|--------|------|------|
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive) | Fs-9 (expected meal) | 0.7 | 1 | Horizontal |
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive) | Fs-31 (preference order) | 0.7 | 1 | Horizontal |
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive) | Fs-116 (hidden purpose)=0 | 0.6 | 2 | Exclusion |
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive) | D-5 (verification)=0 | 0.6 | 2 | Exclusion |

| Fs-69 (waiter knows) | Fs-77 (IS real) | 0.7 | 1 | Horizontal |

### Step 5: Soundness

1. **Consistency**: No descriptor assigned both 1 and 0. ✓
2. **Grounds for 0**: All P_pred(d)=0 have identified grounds in P_pred(d)=1. ✓
3. **Closure**: All R(P0) edges within 判定域(P0). ✓
4. **Root existence**: Roots (Fs-14, Fs-31, Fs-103, Fs-69) all P_pred=1. ✓
5. **Internal consistency**: P_pred(d)=1 set is mutually consistent. ✓

## P1: Past Connection

### Step 1: Interpretation

The man has a specific personal connection to turtle soup from his past. He came to the restaurant not for an ordinary meal but to eat turtle soup for a particular reason rooted in his history. His ordering was deliberate and meaningful, not casual. However, the specific nature of his past experience and why it led to suicide remains unknown. Perhaps he lost someone close who loved turtle soup, or it reminds him of a significant past event.

### Step 2: P_pred(d)=1

| Descriptor | Justification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Ps-1 to Ps-6 | Direct observation |
| Fs-25 (specific interest in turtle soup) | Core of P1 |
| Fs-26 (encountered turtle soup before) | Core of P1 |
| Fs-27 (past connection drove choice) | Core of P1 |
| Fs-28 (wants to taste again/verify) | Natural consequence |
| Fs-29 (anticipation or anxiety) | Emotional consequence |
| Fs-30 (deliberate choice) | Consequence of past connection |
| Fs-116 (hidden purpose beyond eating) | Core of P1 |
| Fs-34 (soup served) | Observation |
| Fs-69 (waiter knows) | Common assumption |
| Fs-70 (waiter tells truth) | Common assumption |
| Fs-77 (IS real turtle soup) | Waiter's confirmation |
| Fs-87 (deliberate suicide) | From Ps-6 |
| Fs-88 (restaurant triggered suicide) | P1 connects restaurant to death |
| Fs-121 (past experience created violated expectation) | P1's explanation framework |

### Step 3: P_pred(d)=0

| Descriptor | Justification | Ground (P_pred=1) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Fs-14 (ordinary motive) | Visit has personal significance | Fs-116 |
| Fs-15 (ordinary visit) | Visit is purpose-driven | Fs-116 |
| Fs-31 (random preference) | Choice is deliberate | Fs-30 |
| Fs-103 (unrelated to restaurant) | Restaurant is the trigger | Fs-88 |
| Fs-47 (stopped because bad taste) | Stopped for comparison, not dislike | Fs-28 |
| Fs-65 (questioned because looks wrong) | Questioned because of taste memory | Fs-27 |

Ft descriptors about the specific past (Ft-1 shipwreck, Ft-84 cannibalism, etc.) remain **不定** — P1 knows there's a past connection but doesn't know its specific nature.

## P2: Taste Discrepancy

### Step 1: Interpretation

The man previously ate something labeled "turtle soup" that tasted completely different from what the restaurant serves. One sip was enough to detect the discrepancy. His question to the waiter was diagnostic: if this is real turtle soup, then what he ate before was not turtle soup at all — he was deceived. Someone in his past lied to him about the food's identity. The deception has now been proven. But why this realization leads to suicide is not yet clear — perhaps what he actually ate was something unusual or alarming, or the deception itself was deeply hurtful.

### Step 2: P_pred(d)=1

| Descriptor | Justification |

| Ft-62 (genuinely found turtle on island) | P2 now knows the prior food wasn't turtle | Fs-78 |

Specific Ft descriptors (what the food actually was, the survival scenario) remain **不定** — P2 knows there was deception but not the specific nature of the deceptive food.

## P3: Taboo Discovery

### Step 1: Interpretation

The man was once in extreme circumstances (a survival situation) where he was given food falsely labeled as "turtle soup." The food was actually made from something that violates a fundamental moral or social taboo — something so terrible that the truth had to be concealed from him. The deception was an act of desperate survival, not malice. At the restaurant, the taste of real turtle soup proved the deception, and the man deduced what he had actually consumed. The horror of this realization — that he unknowingly violated a deep taboo — was psychologically unbearable, leading to suicide.

### Step 2: P_pred(d)=1

| Descriptor | Justification |

### Step 3: P_pred(d)=0

| Ft-31 (adequate food available) | Food ran out | Ft-152 |
| Ft-94 (different animal available) | If normal food was available, no taboo act | Ft-63 |

Specific details of the survival scenario (shipwreck specifically, companion's death, etc.) remain **不定** or partially predicted. P3 knows there was a survival situation and taboo food, but may not know the exact nature of the food (human flesh) or the exact circumstances (shipwreck).

## T (P4): Full Truth

### Step 1: Interpretation

The man was once shipwrecked with several companions. When their food ran out, one companion died. The other survivors prepared a soup from the dead companion's flesh and told the man it was "turtle soup." He ate it unknowingly, believing them. Years later, when the man tasted real turtle soup at the restaurant, he realized the flavor was completely different. The waiter's confirmation that it was genuine turtle soup proved that what he had eaten on the island was not turtle soup but human flesh — the meat of his dead companion. Overwhelmed by horror and despair at this realization, he killed himself that night.

## Sub-path Paradigms

### S1: Poisoning Theory

**Interpretation**: The soup might be poisoned or contaminated. The man detected something wrong, asked the waiter, but the answer didn't resolve his concern. He kills himself to prevent a worse death.

**P_pred(d)=1 (key)**: Fs-47 (bad/dangerous taste), Fs-48 (health concerns), Fs-87 (suicide)
**P_pred(d)=0 (key)**: Fs-79 (past deception) — no deception framework; Fs-116 (hidden purpose) — it's a reactive response, not a planned visit

**Anomalies at O***: Fs-47=1 but O*=0, Fs-48=1 but O*=0, Fs-85=1 but O*=0

### S2: Investigation Theory

**Interpretation**: The man suspected the restaurant of food fraud and came to test their claims. He is an investigator or concerned citizen verifying food authenticity.

**P_pred(d)=1 (key)**: D-5 (verification mission), Fs-116 (hidden purpose), Fs-84 (waiter might be lying)
**P_pred(d)=0 (key)**: Fs-27 (personal past connection) — it's professional, not personal

**Anomalies at O***: Fs-84=1 but O*=0 (waiter was truthful), Fs-85=1 but O*=0

### S3: Crime/Guilt Theory

**Interpretation**: "Turtle soup" was code for something criminal in the man's past. Encountering real turtle soup triggers guilt about the past crime.

**P_pred(d)=1 (key)**: Fs-104 (past trauma from crime), Ft-156 (deception)
**P_pred(d)=0 (key)**: Ft-152 (extreme survival circumstances) — it's crime, not survival

**Anomalies at O***: Fs-104=1 but O*=0 (T specifies shipwreck, not crime)
