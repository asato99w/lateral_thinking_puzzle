# Paradigm Discovery

Algorithm: A_深度階層型 (theory/paradigm/group/algorithms/A_深度階層型.md)

## Step 1: Tension Structure Identification

### Core Tension

The central puzzle: Why would poisonous mushrooms cause **relief**? Normally, poisonous = dangerous/negative. The resolution requires understanding that the mushrooms serve as evidence of human presence, not as something directly useful.

### Tension Hierarchy

| Level | Tension | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Poison ↔ Relief | Poisonous mushrooms causing positive emotion contradicts common sense | High |
| T2 | Direct use ↔ Indirect meaning | Mushrooms appear directly relevant but are actually indicators | Medium |
| T3 | Isolation ↔ Human presence | Seems like a remote wilderness scene, but evidence shows people nearby | Medium |
| T4 | Danger ↔ Safety hope | Mr. A was in danger but finds grounds for hope | Medium |

## Step 2: Main Path Discovery

### P0: "Mushroom Seeker" (depth 0)

**Interpretation**: Mr. A specifically sought poisonous mushrooms for some direct purpose — research, medicine, or commercial collection. He was relieved because he found exactly what he was looking for.

- **Tensions resolved**: T1 superficially (relief explained by wanting the mushrooms)
- **Tensions unresolved**: T2 (why would he need poisonous mushrooms?), T3, T4
- **Key understanding**: Mr. A deliberately wanted poisonous mushrooms
- **Naive predictions**: Mr. A is not in danger, came prepared, has a purpose for the mushrooms

### P1: "Wilderness Survivor" (depth 1)

**Interpretation**: Mr. A was in a survival situation in the wilderness. He was relieved because poisonous mushrooms can be processed or detoxified to become edible, or he has some other survival use for them (e.g., using them to catch fish, as insect repellent). His expertise lets him use what others can't.

- **Tensions resolved**: T1 (survival use explains relief), T4 partially (danger acknowledged)
- **Tensions unresolved**: T2 (mushrooms are actually not used), T3
- **Key understanding**: Mr. A is in danger and sees mushrooms as a survival resource
- **Anomaly vs P0**: Mr. A was actually in danger (P0 predicted no danger)

### P2: "Human Trace" (depth 2)

**Interpretation**: Mr. A was lost and in danger. He realized that only poisonous mushrooms remaining means someone had picked the edible ones — people have been in this area. The mushrooms are evidence of human presence, not a direct resource.

- **Tensions resolved**: T1, T2, T3, T4
- **Key understanding**: The mushrooms are indicators, not resources; absence of edible mushrooms → people → rescue hope
- **Anomaly vs P1**: Mushrooms are not used for survival directly (P1 predicted survival use)

### P3 (T): "Lost Forager's Inference" (depth 3)

**Interpretation**: Mr. A was lost in the mountains while mushroom picking. His mushroom expertise allowed him to infer from the pattern (only poisonous remaining) that edible mushrooms had been harvested by other people, meaning people frequent this area. This gave him hope of rescue.

- **All tensions fully resolved**
- **Key understanding**: Complete narrative — mushroom picking → getting lost → observing mushroom pattern → inference chain → hope of rescue
- **Full context adds**: The irony that the very activity that got him lost (mushroom picking) provided the knowledge to save him

## Step 3: Sub-path Discovery

### S1: "Wildlife Deterrent" (branches from P1)

**Interpretation**: Mr. A was in a dangerous wilderness area. He was relieved because poisonous mushrooms deter certain animals (bears, deer) from the area, making it safer for him.

- **P_pred scope**: Poisonous mushrooms repel animals, the area is safer because of the mushrooms
- **Relationship to main path**: Shares P1's premise (danger situation) but diverges on why mushrooms help
- **Dead end**: Animals are not deterred by poisonous mushrooms in this way; doesn't explain "only" poisonous

### S2: "Familiar Ground" (branches from P1)

**Interpretation**: Mr. A recognized the specific species of poisonous mushrooms, which told him he was in a region he had been to before or knew well. Relief came from recognizing familiar territory.

- **P_pred scope**: Mr. A knows these specific mushroom species, recognizing them means he knows the area
- **Relationship to main path**: Uses Mr. A's expertise (like P1) but applies it to location recognition
- **Dead end**: S says "only poisonous" — the focus on "only" and the absence of edible mushrooms is not explained

## Step 4: Reachability Verification

### Anomaly Count Estimation

| Transition | Key Anomalies | Estimated Count |
|---|---|---|
| P0 → P1 | Mr. A was in danger (P0 predicted no danger) | 2-3 |
| P1 → P2 | Mushrooms are not used for survival (P1 predicted survival use) | 2-3 |
| P2 → T | Full context: lost while mushroom picking, complete inference chain | 2-3 |

### Shift Mechanism Check

- P0 → P1: Discovering Mr. A was in danger/distress breaks P0 (which assumed he was a calm researcher). Questions about danger, worry, and survival situations drive this shift.
- P1 → P2: Discovering the mushrooms have no direct survival use breaks P1. Questions about the significance of the mushroom pattern drive this shift.
- P2 → T: Filling in the complete context (mushroom picking activity, the full inference chain) completes understanding. Questions about the original activity and the rescue inference drive this shift.
- S1 → P1/P2: Discovering that animals are not relevant, or that the mushroom pattern indicates human activity, redirects to main path.
- S2 → P1/P2: Discovering that location recognition is not the point, but human presence inference is, redirects to main path.

## Summary

### Main Path

```
P0 (Mushroom Seeker) → P1 (Wilderness Survivor) → P2 (Human Trace) → T (Lost Forager's Inference)
     depth 0                depth 1                    depth 2             depth 3
```

### Sub-paths

```
P1 → S1 (Wildlife Deterrent) — dead end, redirects to P1/P2
P1 → S2 (Familiar Ground) — dead end, redirects to P1/P2
```
