# Question Structure Design

Algorithm: 質問構造設計 (theory/integration/rules/質問構造設計.md)

## Step 1: Anomaly Target Setting

For each paradigm P_i (excluding T), identify the anomaly descriptors — the descriptors whose true values (under T) contradict P_i's predictions.

### P0 ("Mushroom Seeker") Anomaly Targets

P0 predicts Mr. A is a calm researcher, not in danger. T says he was lost and in danger.

| Anomaly Descriptor | P0 predicts | T value | Why anomalous |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fs-5 (was in danger) | 0 | 1 | P0 says no danger; actually in danger |
| Fs-29 (at risk) | 0 | 1 | P0 says not at risk; actually at risk |
| Fs-42 (worried about isolation) | 0 | 1 | P0 says not worried; actually worried |
| Fs-31 (looking for help) | 0 | 1 | P0 says self-sufficient; actually needs help |
| Ft-1 (didn't know way back) | 0 | 1 | P0 says knows location; actually lost |
| Ft-6 (anxiety from being lost) | 0 | 1 | P0 says no anxiety; actually anxious |
| Fs-21 (mushrooms as sign) | 0 | 1 | P0 says direct target; actually signs |
| Fs-40 (absence implies human activity) | 0 | 1 | P0 says irrelevant; actually key |

**Core anomalies for P0→P1 shift**: Fs-5, Fs-29 (danger indicators)

### P1 ("Wilderness Survivor") Anomaly Targets

P1 predicts mushrooms have direct survival use. T says they are evidence only.

| Anomaly Descriptor | P1 predicts | T value | Why anomalous |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fs-38 (others might be in area) | 0 | 1 | P1 says alone; actually others nearby |
| Fs-39 (area visited by others) | 0 | 1 | P1 says unvisited; actually visited |
| Fs-40 (absence implies human activity) | 0 | 1 | P1 says irrelevant; actually key |
| Fs-21 (mushrooms as sign) | 0 | 1 | P1 says food resource; actually signs |
| Ft-22 (area accessible to people) | 0 | 1 | P1 says remote; actually accessible |
| Ft-18 (other pickers visited) | 0 | 1 | P1 says no others; actually others came |

**Core anomalies for P1→P2 shift**: Fs-40, Ft-18 (human presence indicators)

### P2 ("Human Trace") Anomaly Targets

P2 is very close to T but lacks the full narrative context.

| Anomaly Descriptor | P2 predicts | T value | Why anomalous |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fs-41 (can process to edible) | 0 | 0 | ← not anomalous, same prediction |

P2's anomaly set is minimal because P2 already captures the core insight. The shift to T is driven by filling in missing context (mushroom picking activity, full inference chain) rather than by anomalies.

**Note**: Since P2 → T shift must still occur, we need P2 to make at least one naive wrong prediction about the full context:

| Anomaly Descriptor | P2 predicts | T value | Why anomalous |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fs-34 (research/commercial) | 0 | 0 | Same — not anomalous |

**Revision**: P2 needs an anomaly. P2 doesn't explicitly predict what the original activity was. Let me add:
- P2 predicts Ft-8 (original purpose: mushroom foraging) = 0 → Mr. A's reason for being in mountains is unknown/generic
- T says Ft-8 = 1 → specifically was mushroom picking

Updated P2 anomalies:

| Anomaly Descriptor | P2 predicts | T value | Why anomalous |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ft-8 (original purpose was mushroom foraging) | 0 | 1 | P2 doesn't know why Mr. A was in mountains |
| Ft-13 (foraging led to getting lost) | 0 | 1 | P2 doesn't know the causal connection |

**Core anomalies for P2→T shift**: Ft-8, Ft-13 (original activity and its causal role)

## Step 2: Cognitive Reach Paths (Reverse Design)

### P0 Anomaly Reach: Fs-5 (was in danger)

**Target**: Player discovers Mr. A was actually in danger, not on a calm research trip.

**Reverse path**:
1. Player needs to wonder about Mr. A's emotional state → ask about worry/distress
2. Worry/distress implies danger → ask about danger or risk
3. Discovering danger breaks P0 (which predicted no danger)

**Cognitive path**: Fs-1 (anxious before) → Fs-4 (situation caused worry) → Fs-5 (in danger)

**Prerequisites**: Fs-1 requires observing emotional context. Fs-4 requires Fs-1. Fs-5 can be reached from Fs-4.

### P0 Anomaly Reach: Fs-29 (at risk)

**Similar path to Fs-5**: Reached via Fs-4 → Fs-29

### P0 Anomaly Reach: Ft-1 (didn't know way back)

**Target**: Player discovers Mr. A was lost.

**Reverse path**:
1. Player explores where Mr. A was → discovers remote/outdoor setting
2. Explores Mr. A's situation → discovers he was in trouble
3. Specific trouble = lost → can't find way back

**Cognitive path**: Fs-26 (remote location) → Fs-25 (alone) → Ft-1 (lost)

**Prerequisites**: Questions about location and companionship set up the reveal.

### P1 Anomaly Reach: Fs-40 (absence implies human activity)

**Target**: Player discovers the absence of edible mushrooms is the key clue.

**Reverse path**:
1. Player knows about the mushrooms' nature (poisonous only) → already in S
2. Player asks about edible mushrooms → discovers none present (Fs-10)
3. Player asks why none → leads to "someone picked them" (Fs-40)
4. This breaks P1 (which treated mushrooms as direct resource)

**Cognitive path**: Fs-10 (no edible) → Fs-17 (area could have had edible) → Fs-40 (absence implies human activity)

**Prerequisites**: Fs-10 is observable from S. Fs-17 requires thinking about the area's potential. Fs-40 requires both.

### P1 Anomaly Reach: Ft-18 (other pickers visited)

**Target**: Player discovers others have been to this area.

**Reverse path**:
1. Player discovers human activity evidence (Fs-40)
2. Asks who → other foragers/pickers (Ft-18)

**Cognitive path**: Fs-40 → Ft-18

**Prerequisites**: Fs-40 must be known.

### P2 Anomaly Reach: Ft-8 (original purpose was mushroom foraging)

**Target**: Player discovers Mr. A was specifically mushroom picking (not just wandering).

**Reverse path**:
1. Player knows Mr. A was in mountains (from earlier questioning)
2. Asks why → discovers mushroom picking was the activity
3. This connects the dots: mushroom picking → got lost → mushroom evidence → rescue

**Cognitive path**: Fs-28 (outdoor activity) → Ft-8 (mushroom foraging)

**Prerequisites**: Fs-28 or M-1 known.

## Step 3: Layer Structure Configuration

### P0 (Q(P0)) Layer Structure

| Layer | Questions (by topic) | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Surface exploration: mushroom type, purpose, setting | None |
| 1 | Emotional state: worry, anxiety, Mr. A's situation | Fs-8 or Fs-12 (observed mushrooms) |
| 2 | Danger discovery: was Mr. A in danger, at risk, lost | Fs-1 or Fs-4 (emotional distress known) |

**Gate edges for P0**:
- Fs-8 → Fs-1 (mushrooms trigger → emotional context): Layer 0 → Layer 1
- Fs-4 → Fs-5 (worry → danger): Layer 1 → Layer 2

### P1 (Q(P1)) Layer Structure

| Layer | Questions (by topic) | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Survival context: danger confirmed, survival situation | From P0 shift: Fs-5 known |
| 1 | Mushroom significance: edible absence, "only" emphasis | Fs-10 or Fs-14 |
| 2 | Human activity: others picked them, people in area | Fs-40 or Fs-17 |

**Gate edges for P1**:
- Fs-5 → Fs-10 (danger → explores food situation): carries over from shift
- Fs-10 → Fs-40 (no edible → absence implies activity): Layer 1 → Layer 2

### P2 (Q(P2)) Layer Structure

| Layer | Questions (by topic) | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Evidence reading: human presence inference, people nearby | From P1 shift: Fs-40 known |
| 1 | Original activity: why Mr. A was in mountains | Ft-22 or Ft-29 (area context known) |
| 2 | Full connection: mushroom picking → lost → inference | Ft-8 (original activity known) |

**Gate edges for P2**:
- Ft-29 → Ft-8 (near frequented areas → what was he doing): Layer 0 → Layer 1
- Ft-8 → Ft-13 (foraging → led to getting lost): Layer 1 → Layer 2

## Step 4: Material Shortage Check

### Shortage Assessment

| Required Path | Available Descriptors | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P0 Layer 0→1 | Fs-8, Fs-12, Fs-1, Fs-4 | ✅ Sufficient |
| P0 Layer 1→2 | Fs-4, Fs-5, Fs-29, Ft-1 | ✅ Sufficient |
| P1 Layer 0→1 | Fs-5, Fs-10, Fs-17, Fs-14 | ✅ Sufficient |
| P1 Layer 1→2 | Fs-40, Ft-17, Ft-18 | ✅ Sufficient |
| P2 Layer 0→1 | Ft-22, Ft-29, Fs-28, Ft-8 | ✅ Sufficient |
| P2 Layer 1→2 | Ft-8, Ft-13, Ft-36 | ✅ Sufficient |

**Result**: No material shortage detected. Descriptor space is sufficient for the designed question structure.
