Algorithm: E1 (theory/expansion/algorithms/E1.md) + E2 (theory/expansion/algorithms/E2.md)

## E1 Step 1: Fs₁ Generation (Single-descriptor rules applied to Ps)

### From Ps-1 (Mr. A felt relieved)

| ID | Descriptor | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Fs-1 | Mr. A had been anxious or worried before seeing the mushrooms | Premise extraction |
| Fs-2 | Mr. A's emotional state changed from negative to positive | Implication |
| Fs-3 | The relief was sudden, triggered upon seeing the mushrooms | 5W1H (When) |
| Fs-4 | Mr. A was in a situation that caused worry or distress | Premise extraction |
| Fs-5 | Mr. A had been in danger or a threatening situation | Implication |
| Fs-6 | Mr. A expected a bad outcome before the mushroom sighting | Premise extraction |
| Fs-7 | Mr. A was not happy or calm before seeing the mushrooms | Negation hypothesis |
| Fs-8 | The mushrooms were the direct trigger for the relief | Causal extraction |

### From Ps-2 (Only poisonous mushrooms were around)

| ID | Descriptor | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Fs-9 | The mushrooms in the area are identifiably poisonous | Implication |
| Fs-10 | There are no edible mushrooms in the area | Implication (from "only poisonous") |
| Fs-11 | Mr. A can distinguish poisonous from edible mushrooms | Premise extraction |
| Fs-12 | Mr. A observed the mushrooms visually and identified them | 5W1H (How) |
| Fs-13 | The area is a natural environment where mushrooms grow | 5W1H (Where) |
| Fs-14 | The word "only" emphasizes that nothing else of relevance was present | Emphasis extraction |
| Fs-15 | Poisonous mushrooms have distinctive visual features | Premise extraction |
| Fs-16 | Mr. A was outdoors in a mushroom-growing habitat (forest, mountains) | 5W1H (Where) |
| Fs-17 | The area once had or could have had edible mushrooms | Negation hypothesis |

### From Ps-3 (Relief caused by seeing the mushrooms)

| ID | Descriptor | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Fs-19 | The poisonous mushrooms carry meaning beyond their toxicity | Implication |
| Fs-20 | Mr. A's relief is not about eating the mushrooms (they're poisonous) | Implication |

| Fs-23 | The sight triggered a mental process leading to relief | Causal extraction |
| Fs-24 | Mr. A derived something positive from a seemingly negative observation | Tension extraction |

### Tension relationship extraction from Ps pairs

| Pair | Tension | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Ps-1 × Ps-2 | Relief from poisonous mushrooms is paradoxical — normally poisonous = negative | High (core mystery) |
| Ps-2 × Ps-3 | Poisonous mushrooms as cause of relief contradicts common sense | High |

### From Pt-6 (Mr. A realized people were nearby)

| ID | Descriptor | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Ft-26 | Mr. A made a logical inference from the mushroom evidence | Direct |

### Hidden motive inference (全体)

| ID | Descriptor | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Ft-36 | Mr. A's mushroom-picking background gave him the specific knowledge to make this inference | Hidden motive |
| Ft-37 | The inference chain (poisonous only → edible picked → people → rescue) is the key reasoning | Hidden motive |
