# Internal Structure Construction

Algorithm: A_内部構造構成 (theory/paradigm/internal/algorithms/A_内部構造構成.md)

## P0: "Mushroom Seeker"

### Step 1: Interpretation

Mr. A is a mushroom expert (mycologist, researcher, or commercial collector) who specifically came to this area to find poisonous mushrooms. He was relieved because he found what he was looking for. He is not in danger — this is a routine collecting trip.

### Step 2: P_pred(d) = 1

| Descriptor | Value | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Ps-1 | 1 | Mr. A felt relieved (given) |
| Ps-2 | 1 | Only poisonous mushrooms around (given) |
| Ps-3 | 1 | Relief caused by mushrooms (given) |
| Fs-8 | 1 | Mushrooms directly triggered relief |
| Fs-9 | 1 | Mushrooms are identifiably poisonous |
| Fs-11 | 1 | Mr. A can distinguish mushroom types |
| Fs-12 | 1 | Mr. A visually identified them |
| Fs-13 | 1 | Natural environment where mushrooms grow |
| Fs-16 | 1 | Outdoors in mushroom habitat |
| Fs-27 | 1 | Mr. A is knowledgeable about mushrooms |
| Fs-33 | 1 | Mr. A is a mushroom expert |
| Fs-34 | 1 | Collecting for research/commercial purposes |
| Fs-35 | 1 | Poisonous mushrooms have value |
| Fs-36 | 1 | Mr. A planned to harvest them |
| Fs-28 | 1 | Engaged in outdoor activity |
| Fs-32 | 1 | Needs something specific from mushrooms |

### Step 3: P_pred(d) = 0

| Descriptor | Value | Grounds |
|---|---|---|
| Fs-5 | 0 | P0 assumes no danger — routine collection trip |
| Fs-29 | 0 | Not at risk in this paradigm |
| Fs-42 | 0 | Not worried about isolation |
| Fs-25 | 0 | Not necessarily alone in a worrying sense |
| Fs-31 | 0 | Not looking for help — self-sufficient |
| Ft-1 | 0 | Not lost — knows where he is |
| Ft-6 | 0 | No anxiety from being lost |
| Fs-21 | 0 | Mushrooms are not signs — they are the direct target |
| Fs-40 | 0 | Absence of edible mushrooms is irrelevant |

### Step 4: Relation Structure R(P0)

| Source | Target | Weight | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fs-33 | Fs-11 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Expert → can distinguish |
| Fs-33 | Fs-27 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Expert → knowledgeable |
| Fs-34 | Fs-36 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Research purpose → planned harvest |
| Fs-35 | Fs-32 | 0.7 | Rule 2: Mushrooms have value → needs them |
| Fs-36 | Fs-8 | 0.7 | Rule 1: Planned harvest → mushrooms trigger relief |
| Fs-11 | Fs-12 | 0.7 | Rule 1: Can distinguish → visually identified |
| Fs-33 | Fs-5 | 0.6 | Rule 3: Expert (calm) → not in danger |

### Step 5: Soundness Verification

- No contradictions within P_pred
- Base: Ps-1, Ps-2, Ps-3 are grounded in S
- Closure: All predicted descriptors reachable through R(P0)
- Root: Fs-33 (expertise) and Fs-34 (research purpose) serve as roots

## P1: "Wilderness Survivor"

### Step 1: Interpretation

Mr. A is in a dangerous wilderness survival situation. He has mushroom knowledge and was relieved because he can process or use poisonous mushrooms for survival (e.g., detoxifying by boiling, using as bait, etc.). His expertise makes seemingly dangerous mushrooms a survival resource.

### Step 2: P_pred(d) = 1

| Descriptor | Value | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Ps-1 | 1 | Relief (given) |
| Ps-2 | 1 | Only poisonous mushrooms (given) |
| Ps-3 | 1 | Relief from mushrooms (given) |
| Fs-1 | 1 | Was anxious before |
| Fs-4 | 1 | Situation caused worry |
| Fs-5 | 1 | Was in danger |
| Fs-7 | 1 | Not happy before seeing mushrooms |
| Fs-8 | 1 | Mushrooms triggered relief |
| Fs-9 | 1 | Mushrooms identifiably poisonous |
| Fs-11 | 1 | Can distinguish types |
| Fs-13 | 1 | Natural environment |
| Fs-16 | 1 | Outdoors in mushroom habitat |
| Fs-27 | 1 | Knowledgeable about mushrooms |
| Fs-28 | 1 | Outdoor activity |
| Fs-29 | 1 | At risk |
| Fs-37 | 1 | Mountainous/forested area |
| Fs-41 | 1 | Can process poisonous mushrooms to edible |
| Fs-32 | 1 | Needs something from mushrooms (food) |
| M-1 | 1 | Dangerous outdoor situation |

### Step 3: P_pred(d) = 0

| Descriptor | Value | Grounds |
|---|---|---|
| Fs-34 | 0 | Not research — survival situation |
| Fs-36 | 0 | Not planned harvest — emergency foraging |
| Fs-38 | 0 | P1 assumes no others nearby |
| Fs-39 | 0 | Area not visited by others |
| Fs-40 | 0 | Absence of edible mushrooms is not meaningful as evidence |
| Fs-21 | 0 | Mushrooms are not signs — they are food resource |
| Ft-22 | 0 | Area not accessible to people (remote) |
| Ft-18 | 0 | No other pickers visited |

### Step 4: Relation Structure R(P1)

| Source | Target | Weight | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fs-5 | Fs-1 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Danger → was anxious |
| Fs-5 | Fs-4 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Danger → worry |
| Fs-5 | Fs-29 | 0.9 | Rule 1: Danger → at risk |
| Fs-27 | Fs-41 | 0.7 | Rule 2: Knowledge → can process mushrooms |
| Fs-41 | Fs-32 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Can process → needs mushrooms for food |
| Fs-41 | Fs-8 | 0.7 | Rule 1: Can process → mushrooms trigger relief |
| Fs-5 | Fs-38 | 0.6 | Rule 3: Danger/remote → no others |
| Fs-5 | M-1 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Danger → dangerous situation |

### Step 5: Soundness Verification

- No contradictions within P_pred
- Base: Ps facts grounded; Fs-5 (danger) is the key new assertion
- Closure: Reachable through R(P1) from Fs-5 and Fs-27
- Root: Fs-5 (danger) and Fs-27 (knowledge) serve as roots

## P2: "Human Trace"

### Step 1: Interpretation

Mr. A was in danger (lost or stranded). He realized that only poisonous mushrooms remaining means someone had picked the edible ones — evidence that people frequent this area. The mushrooms are evidence, not a resource. This gives him hope of finding people or being found.

| Ft-14 | 1 | Edible mushrooms had been present |
| Ft-15 | 1 | Edible removed by external agent |
| Ft-16 | 1 | Poisonous left untouched |
| Ft-17 | 1 | Selective removal = human activity |
| Ft-18 | 1 | Other pickers visited |

| D-3 | 1 | Absence of edible = evidence of foraging |
| D-7 | 1 | Sign = evidence of human activity |
| B-2 | 1 | Absence of edible connects to human harvesting |

### Step 3: P_pred(d) = 0

| Descriptor | Value | Grounds |
|---|---|---|
| Fs-34 | 0 | Not research — evidence reading |
| Fs-36 | 0 | Not planned harvest |
| Fs-41 | 0 | Not processing mushrooms for food |
| Fs-32 | 0 | Doesn't need mushrooms directly |
| Fs-35 | 0 | Mushrooms not valued for themselves |

### Step 4: Relation Structure R(P2)

| Source | Target | Weight | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fs-5 | Fs-1 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Danger → anxiety |
| Fs-5 | Fs-42 | 0.8 | Rule 1: Danger → worried about isolation |

| Ft-29 | Ft-30 | 0.9 | Rule 1: Near people → rescue possible |
| Fs-11 | Ft-17 | 0.7 | Rule 2: Can distinguish → can infer selective removal |
| Fs-5 | Fs-41 | 0.6 | Rule 3: Danger → not processing (mismatch) |

### Step 5: Soundness Verification

- No contradictions
- Base: Ps grounded; Fs-5 (danger) and Fs-18 (notable absence) are key assertions
- Closure: Comprehensive inference chain from observation to rescue hope
- Root: Fs-5 (danger), Fs-18 (notable absence), Fs-44 (can read clues)

## P3 (T): "Lost Forager's Inference"

### Step 1: Interpretation

Mr. A was lost in the mountains while mushroom picking. His mushroom-picking expertise allowed him to infer from the pattern of remaining mushrooms (only poisonous) that edible mushrooms had been harvested by other foragers, meaning people frequent this area. This gave him hope of rescue. The very skill that led to him getting lost also provided the knowledge to find hope.
